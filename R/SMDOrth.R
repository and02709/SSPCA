# This function decomposes a matrix using singular value decomposition but 
#   constructs the new u vectors such that they are orthogonal to the previous
#   vectors
# The resulting eigenvector corresponding to the loadings in then shrunk
#   using an L1 penalty where the u vectors are orthogonal to previous u
#   vectors.
# @param x this is the matrix which is decomposed and the decomposition vectors
#   corresponding to the loadings are shrunk
# @param us this tells the us the previous u vectors for which we wish
#   to construct new u vectors that are orthogonal
# @param sumabsv this parameter determines by how much the decomposition vectors
#   corresponding to the loadings
# @param niter number of iterations to allow for convergence
# @param trace option to deisplay potential warnings
# @param v allows a particular loadings vector to be used
# @param vpos allows the option to force the vector corresponding to 
#   loadings to correspond to the parallel maxima using pmax
# @param vneg allows the option to force the vector corresponding to 
#   loadings to correspond to the parallel minima using pmin

# Function accepts the matrix x to decompose and employs sparseness using
#   L1 penalty on the vectors corresponding the loadings
